This is a custom web navigation bar for a desktop website

For mobile go to: https://github.com/finlayfoulds/Mobile-Custom-Web-Navigation.git


Adding or Removing Clickables:

To add clickables copy and paste other ones and substitute in href attribute values and the svg icons inside. Make sure they keep the class clickable or the JavaScript will not work

Each clickable is by default 50px and their ancestor (the #navigation-control-container) is 200px in height which will need to be increased or decreased relative to the amount of clickables removed or added. (50px per clickable)
